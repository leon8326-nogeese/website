    <p>Hi! I'm Leon and i made this website (which you probably already know). I'm working on a Linux distribution for a more user friendly expierience.</p>
    <p>While doing so, i got so many ideas and now, i'm here with it almost at it's beta in only it existing for 2 WEEKS (I'm not joking.)</p>
    <p>(UPDATE: Will release at the end of this month (2.2025) due to holidays.)</p>
    <p>I'm starting an Open-Source Community, (Maybe not big, but i don't need that many people.) that has already got some <a href="https://github.com/leon8326-nogeese">projects</a>.</p>
