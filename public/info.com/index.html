    <h1>info.com</h1>
    <p>You might be new here, and you came to the best place to start on this website.</p>
    <p>This website is maintained by me, <a href="https://leon8326.neocities.org/aboutme">Leon</a></p>
    <p>I made it mostly for <a href="https://leon8326.neocities.org/nogeese">Nogeese</a></p>
    <p>But I wanted to share a couple of things here.</p>

    <br>

    <h1>What's Linux???</h1>
    <p>Linux is a free and open-source kernel, inspired by UNIX but not derived from it.</p>
    <p>When people say "Linux," they often mean "GNU/Linux," which combines the Linux kernel with GNU software.</p>
    <p>The GNU Project, which is also free and open-source, provides many essential tools used in Linux distributions.</p>
    <p>Most Linux distributions use the GNU userland alongside the Linux kernel to create a complete operating system.</p>

    <br>

    <h1>What's Nogeese Linux?</h1>
    <p>Nogeese Linux is a Linux distribution made by me, i think it's an "Arch Linux can be user-friendly" kinda distro. </p>
    <p>It runs the KDE MegaRelease 6. </p>
    <p>I'm also thinking about a GNOME 3 flavor.</p>
    <p>It won't be a stock GNOME 3 experience. </p>
    <p>It will have a lot of extensions. </p>
